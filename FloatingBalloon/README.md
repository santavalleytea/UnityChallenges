# Floating Balloon Challenge

This Unity project focuses on simple gameplay mechanics of a floating balloon in addition to sound and effects that the balloon makes depending on its interactions with various obstacles.

## Features

1. **Player Input**:
   - **Spacebar**: Controls the floating of the balloon.
2. **Obstacles**: A dollar sign indicating an object to collect, and a bomb in which if the player collides into it, the game ends.

## Learnings

- Adding sound and particle effects depending on its respective events.
- Setting colliders onto the objects in order for each object to detect when it has collided with eachother.
- Setting up a random number generator in order for the obstacles to spawn at random positions at various times.
- Adding audio to the main camera to add a more immersive audio experience.

## Acknowledgements

- The animations and models were taken directly from the UnityLearn website, in addition to fundamental game logic.
