## Introduction

This repository is a collection of Unity challenges and exercises that I've completed to improve my skills in game development. Each challenge focuses on a specific area of Unity, such as player controls, environment setup, physics interactions etc.

## Challenges Overview

These are challenges on the Learn Unity website, however I have implemented some additional mechanics in order to make it a bit more original and applying my own work.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Navigate to a Challenge Folder**: Each challenge has its own folder. You can find details and instructions within the folder.
2. **Read the README**: Each challenge folder contains a README file that provides an overview, setup instructions, and key learning points.
3. **Open the Unity Project**: To explore or modify the project, open it in Unity by selecting the relevant folder.

## Challenges List

Here is a list of the challenges included in this repository:

1. **[Player Control Challenge](PlayerControl/README.md)**: A challenge to implement basic movement and controls of an object (in this case a plane) using Unity.
2. **[Basic Gameplay Challenge](BasicGameplay/README.md)**: A challenge implementing basic game mechanics such as throwing multiple projectiles at another object.
