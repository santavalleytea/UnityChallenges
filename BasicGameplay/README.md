# Fetch Gameplay Challenge

This Unity project is a simple game where a player send a dog towards a falling ball in order to simulate a simple "fetch" gameplay.

## Features

1. **Player Input**:
   - **Spacebar**: Sends a dog out in a straight line forward
2. **Falling Object**: A ball constantly falls from the sky at random times (between 3 to 5 seconds) for the player to catch with their dog.
3. 
## Learnings

- Set up prefabs and instantiate an object in order to act as a projectile sent out by the player.
- Setting colliders onto the objects in order for each object to detect when it has collided with eachother.
- Setting up a random number generator in order for the ball to spawn at random times.

## Acknowledgements

- The animations and models were taken directly from the UnityLearn website, in addition to fundamental game logic.
