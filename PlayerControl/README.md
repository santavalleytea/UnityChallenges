# Plane Control Challenge

This Unity project is a simple plane control simulation where you  fly a plane around using basic input controls. The primary goal of this challenge was to apply skills learned from a driving simulation tutorial to create a plane simulation with custom features.

## Features

1. **Plane Movement**: The plane can pitch up and down using the keyboard inputs:
   - **Up Arrow**: Pitches the plane nose down.
   - **Down Arrow**: Pitches the plane nose up.
   
2. **Rotating Propeller**: A custom feature where the plane's propeller rotates continuously, simulating real-life propeller movement.

3. **Dynamic Camera Follow**: The camera dynamically follows the plane from behind, adjusting its position and rotation based on the plane’s movement. This creates a more immersive and realistic flying experience. Unlike a fixed camera, it turns with the plane, keeping it in view at all times.

## Learnings

- This project helped solidify understanding of Unity’s input system and how to control object movement based on user input.
- Implemented a camera-follow script to dynamically adjust the camera's position and rotation relative to the plane.
- Applied simple animations to create a rotating propeller effect, adding realism to the plane model.

## Acknowledgements

- The basic plane movement was implemented using techniques learned from Unity's driving simulation tutorials.
- Custom implementations such as the rotating propeller and dynamic camera follow were added to enhance the challenge and personal learning experience.
